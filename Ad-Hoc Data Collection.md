# Ad-Hoc Data Collection

The **Ad-Hoc Data Collection** feature in the **CivilScout App** allows users to submit spontaneous, geo-tagged data requests based on real-time observations. CivilScouts can leave requests for specific data at a particular location, which can then be fulfilled by other CivilScouts or drone operators who are nearby. This feature is ideal for capturing time-sensitive or location-specific data that may be difficult to plan for in advance.

## How It Works

### 1. Create a Geo-Tagged Request
CivilScouts can create an ad-hoc data request by dropping a pin on a map at a specific location (e.g., a park, wildlife area, or urban environment). The request includes:
- **Location**: The exact GPS coordinates where the data should be collected.
- **Description**: A brief description of what data is needed (e.g., "I saw a black bear here but couldn’t take a picture. Can someone capture it if they see it?").
- **Time Frame**: Specify how long the request should remain active (e.g., 24 hours, 48 hours, or 1 week).
- **Type of Data Requested**: CivilScouts can specify whether they need photos, videos, or other types of data (e.g., temperature readings, air quality measurements).

### 2. View and Fulfill Requests
Other CivilScouts or drone operators in the area can view these geo-tagged requests through their app’s interactive map interface. They can:
- **Accept the Request**: If they are in the vicinity and able to fulfill the request, they can accept it.
- **Capture the Required Data**: Once accepted, they must capture and submit the requested data (e.g., a photo of wildlife or environmental conditions).
  
### 3. Submission and Payment
After fulfilling the request:
- The original requester (the CivilScout who created the ad-hoc request) will review the submitted data.
- If the requester is satisfied with the submission, payment is processed through smart contracts using **CIVIL tokens**.
- Additional rewards may be given for high-quality submissions or quick responses.

## Example Use Cases

### Wildlife Sighting
A CivilScout hiking in Yosemite spots a black bear but is unable to take a picture. Using the Ad-Hoc Data Collection feature, they drop a geo-tagged request asking other scouts or drone operators to capture an image if they see the bear. The request remains active for 24 hours, allowing anyone nearby to fulfill it by submitting a photo of the bear.

### Environmental Monitoring
A CivilScout notices unusual environmental conditions (e.g., flooding, forest fires) but cannot capture enough data themselves. They create an ad-hoc request asking others in the area to document these conditions with photos or videos.

### Event Coverage
A CivilScout witnesses an event (e.g., protest, festival) but cannot fully document it themselves. They create an ad-hoc request asking others nearby to take additional footage.

## Payment and Rewards

Once an ad-hoc request is fulfilled:
- Payments are processed using **CIVIL tokens**, ensuring seamless transactions between CivilScouts and those fulfilling requests.
- Smart contracts automatically handle payments once the requester confirms that the submitted data meets their requirements.
- Additional rewards may be given for exceptional submissions (e.g., high-quality images or videos).

## Benefits of Ad-Hoc Data Collection

### Flexibility
The Ad-Hoc Data Collection feature provides flexibility for CivilScouts who may not always have time to plan formal data collection projects but still want to contribute valuable data based on real-time observations.

### Community Collaboration
This feature encourages collaboration between CivilScouts and drone operators by allowing them to work together on spontaneous data collection efforts. It also enables scouts to help each other by fulfilling requests that benefit both parties.

### Monetization Opportunities
CivilScouts who fulfill ad-hoc requests have opportunities to earn **CIVIL tokens** by contributing valuable data that meets specific requirements. This incentivizes high-quality contributions and ensures that participants are fairly compensated for their efforts.

## Technical Requirements

### Device Compatibility
The Ad-Hoc Data Collection feature is available on devices running:
- iOS 14.0 or later.
- Android 10.0 or later.
  
### Network Requirements
To ensure smooth operation:
- A stable internet connection is required for submitting requests and receiving data.
