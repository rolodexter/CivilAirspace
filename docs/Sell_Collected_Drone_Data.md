# Sell Collected Drone Data

The **Sell Collected Drone Data** feature in the **Drone Operator App** allows drone operators to monetize the data they collect during their operations. This feature enables operators to list their aerial imagery, environmental data, or other sensor-based data on the CivilAirspace marketplace, where researchers, businesses, and other data consumers can purchase or license it.

## Key Features

### 1. List Data on the Marketplace
Drone operators can easily list their collected data on the CivilAirspace marketplace for sale or licensing:
- **Upload Data**: Upload collected aerial imagery, videos, or other sensor-based data (e.g., LiDAR, thermal imaging) directly through the app.
- **Set Licensing Terms**: Define usage rights for the data (e.g., exclusive use, shared use) and specify whether it is available for purchase or licensing.
- **Set Pricing**: Operators can set their own pricing based on market demand and the value of the data. Pricing can be set per dataset or per usage period (e.g., one-time purchase vs. recurring license).
  
### 2. Manage Data Listings
Once data is listed on the marketplace, drone operators can manage their listings through a dedicated dashboard:
- **Edit Listings**: Modify pricing, licensing terms, or descriptions of the data at any time.
- **Remove Listings**: If a dataset is no longer available or needs to be updated, operators can remove it from the marketplace.
- **Track Sales Performance**: View real-time analytics on how well each dataset is performing in terms of views, inquiries, and sales.

### 3. Data Quality Verification
Before being listed on the marketplace, all datasets undergo a quality verification process:
- **Compliance Check**: Ensure that all data complies with CivilAirspace’s quality standards (e.g., resolution requirements for images/videos).
- **Verification by Credentialing Nodes**: Credentialing nodes verify that the drone operator has valid credentials and that the data was collected in compliance with airspace regulations.
- **Approval Process**: Once verified, the data is approved for listing on the marketplace.

### 4. Payment Processing with CIVIL Tokens
All transactions within the CivilAirspace marketplace are processed using **CIVIL tokens**, ensuring secure and efficient payments:
- **Instant Payments**: Once a sale is completed or a license is issued, CIVIL tokens are automatically transferred to the drone operator’s account via smart contracts.
- **Track Earnings**: Operators can track their earnings in real-time through the app’s earnings dashboard.
  
### 5. Licensing Options
Drone operators have flexibility in how they license their data:
- **Exclusive Licensing**: Sell exclusive rights to a dataset, allowing only one buyer to use it.
- **Shared Licensing**: Offer non-exclusive licenses that allow multiple buyers to use the same dataset.
  
### 6. Withdrawals and Conversions
Operators can withdraw their CIVIL tokens from sales or convert them into other supported cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies:
- **Withdrawals**: Transfer CIVIL tokens to an external wallet for storage or further use.
- **Conversions**: Convert CIVIL tokens into other cryptocurrencies (e.g., ETH) or fiat currencies through integrated exchange services.

## Example Use Cases

### Research Data Sales
A drone operator collects aerial imagery of a forest area for environmental monitoring. They list this imagery on the marketplace with exclusive licensing terms and set a price based on market demand. A university researcher purchases exclusive rights to use this imagery in their study.

### Infrastructure Inspection Data Licensing
An operator captures high-resolution footage of a bridge inspection using drones equipped with thermal imaging sensors. They list this footage on the marketplace with shared licensing terms so that multiple engineering firms can purchase access to it for analysis.

### Real Estate Marketing Footage
A real estate company hires a drone operator to capture aerial footage of properties for marketing purposes. The operator lists this footage on the marketplace with non-exclusive licensing terms so that multiple real estate agents can purchase and use it in their marketing campaigns.

- iOS 14.0 or later.
