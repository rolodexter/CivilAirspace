# Request Templates

The **Request Templates** feature in the **CivilScout App** provides pre-defined templates that simplify the process of submitting data collection requests. These templates are designed for common use cases such as land surveys, wildlife monitoring, and infrastructure inspections. CivilScouts can select a template, customize it to fit their specific needs, and submit it to drone operators or camera owners for fulfillment.

## Key Features

### 1. Pre-Defined Templates for Common Use Cases
The CivilScout App includes several pre-defined templates that cover a wide range of data collection scenarios:
- **Land Survey Template**: Designed for capturing aerial imagery of land areas for surveying purposes.
- **Wildlife Monitoring Template**: Ideal for observing wildlife in specific regions, with options for recurring data collection.
- **Infrastructure Inspection Template**: Used for inspecting infrastructure such as bridges, pipelines, or roads, with options for high-resolution imagery or thermal imaging.
- **Environmental Monitoring Template**: Suitable for collecting data on environmental changes (e.g., deforestation, flooding) using drones equipped with specialized sensors.

### 2. Customizable Parameters
While each template comes with default parameters, CivilScouts can customize them to fit their specific project requirements:
- **Location**: Define the geographic area where data should be collected using GPS coordinates or an interactive map.
- **Time Frame**: Specify when and how often the data should be collected (e.g., one-time collection, daily, weekly).
- **Altitude (for drones)**: Set the desired altitude at which aerial data should be captured.
- **Sensor Requirements**: Choose from available sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDAR, thermal imaging) depending on the type of data needed.
- **Data Type**: Specify whether you need photos, videos, or other types of data (e.g., temperature readings).

### 3. Streamlined Submission Process
Using a pre-defined template significantly reduces the time it takes to submit a data request:
1. **Select a Template**: Choose from the available templates based on your projectâ€™s needs.
2. **Customize Parameters**: Adjust any parameters that need to be modified (e.g., location, time frame).
3. **Submit Request**: Once customized, submit the request through the app. The request will be sent to available drone operators or camera owners who match your criteria.

### 4. Real-Time Availability Check
Before submitting a request using a template, CivilScouts can check real-time availability of drone operators and camera owners in their desired location:
- **Operator Availability**: See which drone operators are currently available to fulfill your request based on their location and operational readiness.
- **Camera Owner Availability**: View nearby Ring or Google Nest camera owners who can contribute footage from their devices.

## Example Use Cases

### Land Survey for Property Development
A property developer needs aerial imagery of a large plot of land to plan future development. They select the **Land Survey Template**, customize it by specifying the exact GPS coordinates and desired altitude, and submit it to drone operators in the area.

### Wildlife Monitoring in National Parks
A wildlife researcher wants to monitor animal activity in a national park over several weeks. They use the **Wildlife Monitoring Template**, set it to collect footage daily at sunrise, and submit it to nearby drone operators who specialize in wildlife observation.

### Infrastructure Inspection After Natural Disasters
A government agency needs to inspect bridges and roads following a natural disaster. They select the **Infrastructure Inspection Template**, customize it by requesting thermal imaging at multiple angles, and submit it to drone operators equipped with specialized sensors.

## Benefits of Using Request Templates

1. **Time-Saving**: By using pre-defined templates, CivilScouts can quickly submit detailed requests without having to manually input every parameter.
2. **Consistency**: Templates ensure that requests follow standardized formats, making it easier for drone operators and camera owners to understand and fulfill them.
3. **Customization Flexibility**: While templates provide default values, they are fully customizable to meet the specific needs of each project.
4. **Improved Accuracy**: Pre-defined templates reduce the risk of errors when specifying complex parameters like altitude or sensor requirements.
