## Operator Availability Documentation for CivilScout App

The **CivilScout App** is a critical component of the CivilAirspace platform, designed to facilitate drone operators in managing their operations effectively. This documentation outlines the features, functionalities, and operational guidelines for users of the CivilScout App, particularly focusing on operator availability.

### Key Features

- **Geo-tagged Requests**: Operators can submit requests for data collection that are geo-tagged to ensure accurate location tracking.
  
- **Data Collection Parameters**: Users can define specific parameters for data collection, including the type of data required, collection methods, and time frames.

- **Smart Contract Payments**: The app processes payments through smart contracts, ensuring secure and automated transactions.

- **Request Status Tracking**: Operators can monitor the status of their requests in real-time, allowing for better planning and resource allocation.

### Operator Availability Management

#### Availability Scheduling

Operators must maintain an updated availability schedule within the app to ensure efficient data collection and operational management. The following steps outline how to manage availability:

1. **Set Availability Hours**: Operators can define their working hours within the app. This includes setting specific days and times when they are available for data collection.

2. **Update Availability Status**: Operators should regularly update their availability status (available/unavailable) to reflect real-time changes in their schedule.

3. **Notifications for Requests**: The app will notify operators when requests are made during their available hours. If a request is made outside of these hours, operators will receive alerts to adjust their schedules accordingly.

#### Dynamic Availability Adjustments

In high-traffic areas or during peak demand times, operators may need to adjust their availability dynamically:

- **Auto-Adjust Feature**: The app includes an auto-adjust feature that allows operators to increase their availability based on demand. For instance, if multiple requests are received in a short period, operators can opt-in to extend their working hours temporarily.

- **Priority Alerts**: Operators will receive priority alerts for urgent requests that require immediate attention, allowing them to respond swiftly even if they are not currently scheduled to work.

### Compliance and Reporting

To ensure compliance with local regulations and operational standards:

- **Compliance Monitoring**: The app tracks compliance with regulations related to drone operations. Operators must adhere to these regulations while managing their availability.

- **Reporting Mechanisms**: Operators can generate reports on their availability and operational activities, which can be submitted for compliance verification or internal audits.
