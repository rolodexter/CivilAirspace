# Status Monitoring & Alerts

The **Status Monitoring & Alerts** feature in the CivilAirspace network provides real-time updates on the status of ongoing operations. Whether you're a drone operator, camera owner, or CivilScout, this feature ensures that you are always informed about key events, compliance issues, and operational progress. The system sends alerts at critical moments to ensure smooth and safe operations.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Status Monitoring
Users can monitor the status of their ongoing operations in real-time through the appâ€™s dashboard:
- **Operation Progress**: Track the progress of data collection tasks, including aerial surveys, wildlife monitoring, or infrastructure inspections.
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Ensure that all operations comply with regulatory requirements (e.g., Remote ID broadcasts, LAANC authorization).
- **Live Telemetry Data**: For drone operators, access live telemetry data such as altitude, speed, battery levels, and flight path.

### 2. Automated Alerts
The system automatically sends alerts at critical stages of an operation:
- **Request Accepted**: Notification when a drone operator or camera owner accepts a data request.
- **Operation Started**: Notification when data collection begins.
- **Compliance Issues**: Alerts if any compliance issues arise (e.g., Remote ID not broadcasting correctly, unauthorized airspace entry).
- **Operation Completed**: Notification when data collection is completed and ready for review.
- **Emergency Alerts**: Immediate notifications in case of emergency situations (e.g., drone malfunction, airspace conflict).

### 3. Customizable Alert Settings
Users can customize which alerts they want to receive and how they are notified:
- **Notification Channels**: Choose between push notifications, email alerts, or SMS messages for different types of updates.
- **Alert Frequency**: Set preferences for how often you want to be notified (e.g., real-time updates vs. summary notifications).
- **Priority Alerts**: Mark certain types of alerts as high priority (e.g., compliance issues or emergency situations) to ensure they are delivered immediately.

### 4. Incident Reporting
In addition to receiving alerts, users can report incidents directly through the app:
- **Report Compliance Issues**: If a drone operator or camera owner notices any compliance violations during an operation (e.g., unauthorized flight paths), they can report it immediately.
- **Emergency Reporting**: In case of emergencies (e.g., drone crashes or malfunctions), users can trigger an emergency alert that notifies relevant parties (e.g., control towers or safety nodes).

### 5. Historical Logs
All alerts and status updates are logged for future reference:
- **Operation History**: View a history of all alerts related to past operations (e.g., when the operation started, when it completed, any compliance issues encountered).
- **Compliance Logs**: Access detailed logs of any compliance-related alerts that were triggered during an operation.

## Example Use Cases

### Drone Operators
A drone operator is conducting an aerial survey over a restricted area. The Status Monitoring & Alerts feature sends real-time notifications about altitude changes and battery levels while providing immediate alerts if there are any compliance issues with Remote ID broadcasting.

### CivilScouts
A CivilScout submits a request for wildlife monitoring footage. They receive notifications when a drone operator accepts their request and when the operation starts. Once the footage is captured and uploaded, they receive an alert that the data is ready for review.

### Camera Owners
A Ring camera owner contributing footage to the network receives notifications when their footage is accessed or licensed by another user. They also receive alerts if there are any issues with their camera feed during an active request.

## Technical Requirements

- iOS 14.0 or later.
- Android 10.0 or later.

### Network Requirements
