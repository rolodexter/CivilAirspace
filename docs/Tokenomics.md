# Tokenomics

The **CivilAirspace** network operates with a corporate-like economic structure, where **CIVIL tokens** serve as both a currency and a representation of ownership in data assets. This document outlines how CIVIL tokens are used for payments, rewards, profit distribution, and network sustainability.

## 1. Overview of CIVIL Tokens

CIVIL tokens are the native utility tokens of the CivilAirspace network. They are used to:
- Facilitate payments between participants (e.g., drone operators, airspace owners, data requesters).
- Represent fractional ownership in data assets generated by drone operations.
- Distribute profits (dividends) to participants after the network covers its operational costs.
- Provide incentives for compliance and high-quality data contributions.

## 2. Revenue Generation & Profit Sharing

The CivilAirspace network generates revenue by offering services such as:
- **Data Collection Services**: Fees paid by CivilScouts (data requesters) for aerial data.
- **Airspace Usage Fees**: Payments made by drone operators to airspace owners for using their airspace.
- **Network Service Fees**: Fees paid by participants to use CivilAirspace infrastructure (e.g., credentialing nodes, control towers).

### Profit Calculation
After covering operational costs (e.g., node maintenance, compliance enforcement), any remaining funds constitute the networkâ€™s **net profit**.

### Dividend Distribution
Net profits are distributed as dividends to participants based on their contribution to the network:
- **Drone Operators**: Receive dividends based on the amount of data they generate.
- **Airspace Owners**: Receive compensation for allowing their airspace to be used.
- **Network Nodes**: Credentialing nodes, control towers, and safety nodes receive a share of profits for ensuring compliance and safety during operations.

Dividends are distributed in CIVIL tokens via smart contracts that automate payments based on each participant's role in the network.

## 3. Token Utility

### Payments
CIVIL tokens are used as the primary currency within the CivilAirspace ecosystem:
- **Drone Operators**: Earn CIVIL tokens for completing data collection tasks.
- **Airspace Owners**: Receive CIVIL tokens as compensation for allowing their airspace to be used by drone operators.
- **CivilScouts**: Pay for data collection services using CIVIL tokens.

### Ownership Representation
CIVIL tokens also represent fractional ownership in data assets generated by drone operations. This allows both drone operators and the network to share ownership of datasets:
- **Drone Operators** retain a portion of ownership in the data they generate.
- The **CivilAirspace Network** holds a portion of ownership to ensure its sustainability.

### Rewards & Incentives
Participants can earn additional CIVIL tokens through various reward mechanisms:
- **Compliance Rewards**: Drone operators who maintain compliance with Remote ID regulations and other safety protocols receive bonus tokens.
- **Data Quality Rewards**: High-quality data submissions verified by credentialing nodes can result in additional token rewards.
- **Node Participation Rewards**: Nodes that contribute to maintaining network integrity (e.g., credentialing nodes) receive rewards for their efforts.

## 4. Smart Contracts & Automation

Smart contracts play a crucial role in managing token distribution and automating payments within the CivilAirspace network. These contracts ensure transparency and fairness by:
- Automatically distributing dividends based on each participant's contribution.
- Managing payments between CivilScouts, drone operators, airspace owners, and nodes.
- Enforcing compliance with service agreements (e.g., ensuring that payments are only released when data is verified).

### Example Workflow:
1. A CivilScout submits a research request through the CivilScout App and pays in CIVIL tokens.
2. The network automatically allocates a portion of these funds to cover operational costs (e.g., node maintenance).
3. Once operational costs are covered, any remaining funds are distributed as dividends to participants (drone operators, airspace owners).
4. Smart contracts ensure that all transactions are transparent and verifiable on the blockchain.

## 5. Sustainability & Network Growth

The CivilAirspace network is designed to be self-sustaining through its tokenomics model:
- By retaining partial ownership of data assets and collecting service fees from participants, the network generates ongoing revenue.
- This revenue is reinvested into maintaining infrastructure (e.g., control towers, credentialing nodes) and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
- As more participants join the network (e.g., new drone operators or airspace owners), demand for CIVIL tokens increases, driving token value growth.

## 6. Token Allocation & Supply

To ensure long-term sustainability and incentivize participation, CIVIL tokens are allocated as follows:
- **Operational Costs Reserve (30%)**: Used to cover ongoing expenses such as node maintenance and compliance enforcement.
- **Participant Rewards Pool (40%)**: Allocated for rewarding drone operators, airspace owners, and other participants who contribute to the network.
- **Development Fund (15%)**: Reserved for future development and expansion of the CivilAirspace ecosystem.
- **Team & Advisors (10%)**: Allocated to team members and advisors who contribute to building and maintaining the platform.
- **Community Initiatives Fund (5%)**: Set aside for community-driven projects that enhance the CivilAirspace ecosystem.

## 7. Governance

CIVIL token holders play an active role in governing the CivilAirspace network:
- Token holders can vote on key decisions such as changes to service fees or updates to compliance protocols.
- Governance proposals are submitted through smart contracts, ensuring transparency in decision-making processes.
