# Research Data Collection Use Case

## Scenario Overview
A university research team uses their CivilScout account to request aerial survey data to study animal species distribution in a specific geographic area. This case demonstrates how CivilAirspace facilitates collaboration between CivilScouts, airspace owners, and drone operators.

## Workflow

### 1. Research Request Submission
The university research team, through their CivilScout interface:
- Specifies geographic boundaries of study area
- Defines required flight altitudes
- Sets data collection frequency
- Details image/sensor requirements
- Outlines project timeline
- Provides research budget parameters

### 2. Network Response
CivilAirspace network automatically:
- Identifies relevant airspace zones
- Locates participating airspace owners
- Calculates optimal flight paths
- Estimates data collection costs
- Generates default licensing terms

### 3. Airspace Owner Association
- Owners receive automated notifications
- System forms temporary ad-hoc association
- Default terms presented to all parties
- Owners can modify or accept terms
- Smart contract manages group consensus

### 4. Service Agreement
Terms include:
- Access schedules
- Compensation rates
- Data usage rights
- Collection parameters
- Quality requirements
- Delivery timeline

### 5. Operational Execution
- Qualified drone operators bid on collection tasks
- Network coordinates flight operations
- Real-time monitoring of data collection
- Quality assurance checks
- Progress tracking
- Compliance verification

### 6. Value Distribution
Smart contracts manage:
- Research team payments
- Airspace owner compensation
- Drone operator fees
- Network service fees
- Data verification rewards

### 7. Data Delivery
- Verified data stored on IPFS
- Access granted to research team
- Usage rights transferred
- Citation requirements established
- Data provenance recorded
