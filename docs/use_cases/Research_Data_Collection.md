## Workflow

### 1. Research Request Submission
The university research team submits a data collection request specifying:
- Geographic boundaries of study area
- Required flight altitudes
- Data collection frequency
- Image/sensor requirements
- Project timeline
- Research budget parameters

### 2. Network Response
CivilAirspace network automatically:
- Identifies relevant airspace zones
- Locates participating airspace owners
- Calculates optimal flight paths
- Estimates data collection costs
- Generates default licensing terms

### 3. Airspace Owner Association
- Owners receive automated notifications
- System forms temporary ad-hoc association
- Default terms presented to all parties
- Owners can modify or accept terms
- Smart contract manages group consensus

### 4. Service Agreement
Terms include:
- Access schedules
- Compensation rates
- Data usage rights
- Collection parameters
- Quality requirements
- Delivery timeline

### 5. Operational Execution
- Qualified drone operators bid on collection tasks
- Network coordinates flight operations
- Real-time monitoring of data collection
- Quality assurance checks
- Progress tracking
- Compliance verification

### 6. Value Distribution
Smart contracts manage:
- Research team payments
- Airspace owner compensation
- Drone operator fees
- Network service fees
- Data verification rewards

### 7. Data Delivery
- Verified data stored on IPFS
- Access granted to research team
- Usage rights transferred
- Citation requirements established
- Data provenance recorded
