# CivilScout App

The **CivilScout App** is a specialized interface designed for researchers, data consumers, outdoor camera owners (e.g., Ring and Google Nest), and other parties interested in acquiring or contributing data through the CivilAirspace network. This app facilitates the submission of data requests, management of data rights, and interaction with drone operators and camera owners to fulfill specific project needs.

## Core Features

### 1. [Data Request Submission](../docs/Data_Request_Submission.md)
- **[Submit Data Requests](../docs/Submit_Data_Requests.md)**: Users can submit detailed data collection requests (e.g., aerial imagery, environmental data) to drone operators or camera owners.
- **[Customizable Parameters](../docs/Customizable_Parameters.md)**: Specify location, time frame, altitude (for drones), and other parameters for data collection.
- **[Request Templates](../docs/Request_Templates.md)**: Pre-defined templates for common types of data requests (e.g., land surveys, infrastructure inspections).
- **[Real-Time Availability](../docs/Real_Time_Availability.md)**: View available drone operators and outdoor camera owners in real-time and their operational readiness.

### 2. [Outdoor Camera Integration](Outdoor_Camera_Integration)
- **[Ring & Google Nest Camera Interface](../docs/Ring_Google_Nest_Camera_Interface.md)**: Outdoor camera owners can connect their Ring or Google Nest cameras to the CivilAirspace network through an easy-to-use interface. This allows them to contribute video footage as data assets.
- **[Monetize Camera Footage](../docs/Monetize_Camera_Footage.md)**: Camera owners can list their footage on the marketplace for sale or licensing under predefined terms.
- **[Smart Contracts for Licensing](Smart_Contracts_for_Licensing)**: Automatically manage licensing agreements through smart contracts that ensure payments are processed when footage is accessed by buyers.
- **[Privacy & Security Compliance](../docs/Privacy_Security_Compliance_Cameras.md)**: Ensure all video feeds are encrypted and comply with local privacy laws before contributing them as assets.

### 3. [Incidental Footage Contribution](../docs/Incidental_Footage_Contribution.md)
- **[Mobile Camera Feature](../docs/Mobile_Camera_Feature.md)**: The CivilScout app includes a feature that allows users to take photos or short videos using their mobile devices. This incidental footage can be uploaded as data assets and listed on the marketplace for sale or licensing.
- **[Ad-Hoc Data Collection](../docs/Ad_Hoc_Data_Requests.md)**: CivilScouts can contribute data while on the go by capturing relevant information in real-time or leaving geo-tagged requests for others to fulfill. For example, if a scout sees a black bear in Yosemite but cannot take a picture, they can leave a request asking others to capture it if they see it.

### 4. [Data Acquisition Management](../docs/Data_Acquisition_Management.md)
- **[Track Data Requests](../docs/Track_Data_Requests.md)**: Monitor the status of submitted requests, including acceptance, in-progress operations, and completed projects.
- **[Manage Data Rights](../docs/Manage_Data_Rights.md)**: Define ownership and usage rights for collected data. CivilScouts can specify how the data may be used (e.g., exclusive rights or shared use).
- **[Data Delivery](../docs/Data_Delivery.md)**: Receive collected data directly through the app once the operation is completed.

### 5. [Project Management](../docs/Project_Management.md)
- **[Project Dashboard](../docs/Project_Dashboard.md)**: Manage multiple data collection projects simultaneously through a unified dashboard.
- **[Collaborate with Drone Operators & Camera Owners](Collaborate_with_Drone_Operators_and_Camera_Owners)**: Communicate directly with drone operators or camera owners to refine project details and ensure successful completion.
- **[Budget Tracking](../docs/Budget_Tracking.md)**: Track project costs and manage payments using CIVIL tokens or other payment methods.

### 6. [Payment Processing](Payment_Processing)
- **[Multiple Payment Options](../docs/Multiple_Payment_Options.md)**: Support for various payment methods (e.g., crypto, fiat) to facilitate transactions between CivilScouts, drone operators, and camera owners.
- **[Payment Milestones](Payment_Milestones)**: Set up milestone-based payments to ensure that funds are only released upon successful completion of project phases.

#### [Payment with CIVIL Tokens](Payment_with_CIVIL_Tokens)
- CivilScouts use CIVIL tokens to pay for data collection services. Smart contracts ensure that payments are only released when specific conditions are met, such as successful data delivery or verification.

## Interface Design

### [Navigation](../docs/Navigation_CivilScout_App.md)
- **[Bottom Bar Access](../docs/Bottom_Bar_Access.md)**: Quick access to key features such as active projects, new data requests, and payment history.
- **[Project Overview Screens](../docs/Project_Overview_Screens.md)**: Easily track ongoing projects with real-time updates on progress and communication with drone operators or camera owners.

### [Maps Integration](../docs/Maps_Integration_CivilScout_App.md)
- **[Location-Based Requests](../docs/Location_Based_Requests.md)**: Use an interactive map to specify areas where aerial data is needed or where outdoor cameras are located.
- **[Operator & Camera Owner Availability](../docs/Operator_and_Camera_Owner_Availability_CivilScout_App.md)**: View available drone operators and outdoor camera owners in specific regions who can fulfill data requests.
