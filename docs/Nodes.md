# Network Nodes

The CivilAirspace network operates through a distributed system of specialized nodes that work together to enable secure, efficient, and compliant drone operations.

## Node Types

### [Control Towers](docs/Control_Towers.md)
- Real-time airspace coordination
- Traffic management and routing
- Human operator interface
- Emergency response coordination
- Performance monitoring
- Compliance enforcement

### [Credentialing Nodes](docs/Credentialing_Nodes.md)
- Participant validation
- Credential verification
- Airspace ownership verification
- Compliance monitoring
- Changes in ownership/credentials
- Access control management

### [Droneports](docs/Droneports.md)
- Physical infrastructure management
- Landing/takeoff operations
- Charging and maintenance
- Ground operations
- Resource allocation
- Emergency services

### [Safety Nodes](docs/Safety_Nodes.md)
- Emergency response coordination
- Local compliance monitoring
- Safety protocol enforcement
- Incident reporting
- Risk assessment
- Alert management

## Network Architecture

### Node Communication

Nodes communicate using a peer-to-peer messaging protocol that ensures real-time data sharing across the network. Key communication functions include:

- Peer-to-peer messaging for status updates and alerts.
- State synchronization between nodes to ensure accurate data across the network.
  - Example: Control Towers send real-time airspace updates to Droneports for safe takeoff/landing operations.
  
### Consensus Mechanism

The CivilAirspace network uses a decentralized consensus mechanism to validate transactions and ensure state consistency across all nodes. This includes:

- Transaction validation: Ensures that all actions (e.g., flight plans, credential updates) are authorized.
- State verification: Verifies that all nodes have synchronized state information.
  - Example: Credentialing Nodes validate drone operator credentials before allowing access to restricted airspace.

## Technical Requirements

Each node type has specific hardware and network requirements to ensure optimal performance:

### Hardware Specifications

| Node Type          | Processing Capacity | Storage Requirements | Redundancy Systems |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Control Towers      | High                | Medium               | High               |
| Credentialing Nodes | Medium              | High                 | Medium             |
| Droneports          | Low                 | Low                  | High               |
| Safety Nodes        | Medium              | Medium               | High               |

### Network Requirements

All nodes require high-speed connectivity with low latency to ensure real-time communication across the network:

| Requirement          | Description                                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| High-speed connectivity | Ensures real-time communication between nodes       |
| Low latency           | Critical for emergency response and compliance checks|
| Secure communications | End-to-end encryption for all data transmissions     |
| Redundant networking  | Backup systems to ensure continuous operation        |

## Node Operations

Each node performs specific operational tasks that contribute to the overall functionality of the CivilAirspace network:

### Validation Functions

Nodes perform various validation tasks to ensure secure and compliant operations:

1. Transaction verification: Ensures that all actions (e.g., credential updates) are authorized.
2. State validation: Verifies that all nodes have synchronized state information.
3. Data integrity: Ensures that data transmitted between nodes is accurate and unaltered.

### Data Management

Nodes manage large amounts of data related to drone operations, including flight plans, telemetry data, and compliance records:

1. Local storage: Each node stores relevant data locally for fast access.
2. Backup procedures: Regular backups ensure that no data is lost in case of failure.
3. Recovery protocols: In case of failure, recovery protocols restore node functionality quickly.
