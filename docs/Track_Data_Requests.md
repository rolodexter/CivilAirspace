# Track Data Requests

The **Track Data Requests** feature in the **CivilScout App** allows users to monitor the status of their submitted data collection requests in real-time. Whether requesting aerial imagery from drone operators or specific footage from camera owners, this feature ensures that CivilScouts can stay informed about the progress of their projects.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Status Updates
CivilScouts can view real-time updates on the status of their submitted requests, including:
- **Pending Requests**: Requests that have been submitted but not yet accepted by a drone operator or camera owner.
- **Accepted Requests**: Requests that have been accepted and are currently being fulfilled.
- **In-Progress Operations**: Active data collection operations that are underway.
- **Completed Requests**: Requests where data has been collected and delivered.

### 2. Request Details
For each request, CivilScouts can view detailed information, including:
- **Request Parameters**: The specific parameters defined for the request (e.g., location, altitude, time frame, type of data).
- **Assigned Operator/Camera Owner**: The drone operator or camera owner who has accepted the request.
- **Estimated Completion Time**: The estimated time it will take to complete the request.
- **Progress Tracking**: A visual progress bar or percentage indicating how much of the request has been completed.

### 3. Manage Active Requests
CivilScouts can manage their active requests through a dedicated dashboard:
- **Modify Request Parameters**: In some cases, CivilScouts may be able to modify certain parameters (e.g., extend the time frame or adjust the location) if the request has not yet been fulfilled.
- **Cancel Requests**: If a request is no longer needed, CivilScouts can cancel it before it is fulfilled. Any associated payments will be refunded according to the terms of the smart contract.
  
### 4. Data Delivery and Review
Once a request is completed:
- The collected data (e.g., photos, videos) is delivered directly through the app.
- CivilScouts can review and verify that the data meets their requirements before approving payment.
  
### 5. Notifications and Alerts
CivilScouts receive notifications at key stages of the request process:
- **Request Accepted**: Notification when a drone operator or camera owner accepts their request.
- **Data Collection Started**: Notification when data collection begins.
- **Data Collection Completed**: Notification when data collection is finished and ready for review.

## Use Case Scenarios

### Research Projects
A researcher submits a request for aerial imagery over a specific area for environmental monitoring. Using the Track Data Requests feature, they can monitor when a drone operator accepts their request and track progress as the drone captures images over time.

### Ad-Hoc Wildlife Observations
A CivilScout spots wildlife in a park but cannot capture footage themselves. They submit an ad-hoc data request asking others to capture images if they see the animal. The Track Data Requests feature allows them to see when someone accepts their request and when footage is submitted.

### Infrastructure Inspections
A CivilScout submits a request for drone footage to inspect infrastructure (e.g., bridges or pipelines). They can track when an operator accepts the job and monitor progress as footage is captured and delivered.

## Technical Requirements

### Device Compatibility
The Track Data Requests feature is available on devices running:
- iOS 14.0 or later.
- Android 10.0 or later.

### Network Requirements
To ensure smooth operation:
- A stable internet connection is required for real-time updates on data requests and notifications.
