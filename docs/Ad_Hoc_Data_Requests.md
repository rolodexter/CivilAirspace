# Ad-Hoc Data Requests

## Overview

The **Ad-Hoc Data Request** feature allows [[CivilScouts]] to leave geo-tagged requests for specific data in a particular location. These requests can be fulfilled by other CivilScouts or drone operators who are nearby. This feature is ideal for situations where a user sees something interesting but is unable to capture it themselves (e.g., wildlife sightings, environmental observations).

## How It Works

1. **Create a Request**:
   - CivilScouts can drop a geo-tagged request in the app by specifying:
     - **Location**: The exact GPS coordinates where the data should be collected (e.g., where they saw the black bear).
     - **Description**: A brief description of what they are looking for (e.g., "I saw a black bear here but couldnâ€™t take a picture. Can someone capture it if they see it?").
     - **Time Frame**: Specify how long the request should remain active (e.g., 24 hours, 1 week).

2. **View and Fulfill Requests**:
   - Other CivilScouts or drone operators can view these geo-tagged requests on their map interface.
   - If they are near the location and able to fulfill the request, they can accept it and submit the requested data (e.g., a photo of the black bear).

3. **Payment and Rewards**:
   - Once the request is fulfilled, the original requester can review the submitted data.
   - If satisfied, payment is processed through smart contracts using CIVIL tokens.
   - Additional rewards may be given for high-quality submissions or quick responses.

## Use Case Examples

- **Wildlife Sightings**: A CivilScout sees an animal but cannot take a picture. They leave an ad-hoc request for others in the area to capture an image.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: A scout notices unusual environmental conditions (e.g., flooding, forest fires) and requests further documentation from others nearby.
- **Event Coverage**: A scout witnesses an event (e.g., protest, festival) but cannot document it fully. They leave an ad-hoc request for others to capture more footage.

## Technical Requirements

- GPS-enabled device for creating geo-tagged requests.
- Stable internet connection for submitting and receiving data.
