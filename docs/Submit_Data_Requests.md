# Submit Data Requests

The **Submit Data Requests** feature in the **CivilScout App** allows users to request specific data from drone operators or camera owners within the CivilAirspace network. Whether itâ€™s for research purposes, environmental monitoring, or infrastructure inspections, CivilScouts can define detailed data collection requirements and submit them through the app.

## Key Features

### 1. Customizable Parameters
CivilScouts can customize their data requests by specifying various parameters to ensure the data collected meets their exact needs:
- **Location**: Define the geographic area where data should be collected using GPS coordinates or an interactive map.
- **Time Frame**: Specify when the data should be collected (e.g., immediate, scheduled for a future date, or recurring).
- **Altitude (for drones)**: Set the desired altitude at which aerial data should be captured.
- **Sensor Requirements**: Choose from a variety of sensors (e.g., cameras, thermal imaging, LiDAR) depending on the type of data needed.
- **Data Type**: Specify whether you need photos, videos, or other types of data (e.g., environmental readings).

### 2. Request Templates
The CivilScout App provides pre-defined templates for common types of data requests. These templates simplify the process of submitting requests by offering default parameters that can be customized as needed:
- **Land Surveys**: Templates for capturing aerial imagery of land areas for surveying purposes.
- **Wildlife Monitoring**: Templates designed for observing wildlife in specific regions.
- **Infrastructure Inspections**: Templates for inspecting infrastructure such as bridges, pipelines, or roads.

### 3. Real-Time Availability
Before submitting a request, CivilScouts can view the real-time availability of drone operators and camera owners in their desired location:
- **Operator Availability**: See which drone operators are currently available to fulfill your request based on their location and operational readiness.
- **Camera Owner Availability**: View nearby Ring or Google Nest camera owners who can contribute footage from their devices.

### 4. Submitting a Request
Once all parameters are set and availability is confirmed:
1. The CivilScout submits the request through the app.
2. The request is sent to available drone operators or camera owners who match the specified criteria.
3. Operators/camera owners can accept or decline the request based on their capabilities and availability.

### 5. Managing Pending Requests
After submission, CivilScouts can manage their pending requests through a dedicated dashboard:
- **Modify Parameters**: Adjust certain parameters (e.g., time frame) if necessary before an operator accepts the request.
- **Cancel Requests**: If a request is no longer needed, it can be canceled before it is accepted by an operator or camera owner.

## Example Use Cases

### Research Data Collection
A university researcher needs aerial imagery of a specific forest area for environmental monitoring. They use the Submit Data Requests feature to define the location, altitude, and sensor type (e.g., thermal imaging) required for capturing heat signatures of wildlife.

### Infrastructure Inspection
A CivilScout working with a local government agency submits a request for drone footage to inspect a bridge. They use the Infrastructure Inspection template and specify that they need high-resolution images captured at multiple angles.

### Wildlife Monitoring
A conservationist submits a request to monitor wildlife in a national park. They use the Wildlife Monitoring template and specify that they need recurring footage captured at sunrise every day for one week.

## Technical Requirements

### Device Compatibility
The Submit Data Requests feature is available on devices running:
- iOS 14.0 or later.
- Android 10.0 or later.

### Network Requirements
To ensure smooth operation:
- A stable internet connection is required for submitting requests and receiving real-time updates on operator availability.
