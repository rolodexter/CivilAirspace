# Track Earnings

The **Track Earnings** feature in the CivilAirspace platform allows drone operators, camera owners, and CivilScouts to monitor their earnings in real-time. This feature is integrated into the various apps (e.g., Drone Operator App, CivilScout App, Airspace Owner App) to provide users with a clear overview of their financial activities within the network.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Earnings Dashboard
Each user has access to a real-time dashboard that displays their earnings from data sales, licensing agreements, or completed tasks. The dashboard provides:
- **Current Balance**: Displays the current balance of **CIVIL tokens** earned from completed projects or data sales.
- **Pending Payments**: Shows any payments that are pending approval or awaiting completion of milestones.
- **Completed Transactions**: Lists all completed transactions where CIVIL tokens have been successfully transferred to the userâ€™s account.

### 2. Transaction History
Users can view a detailed history of all transactions related to their earnings. This includes:
- **Date and Time**: When the transaction occurred.
- **Amount Earned**: The number of CIVIL tokens earned from each transaction.
- **Source**: The source of the earnings (e.g., data sales, fulfilling ad-hoc requests, airspace licensing).
- **Status**: Whether the transaction is completed or pending.

### 3. Earnings Analytics
The platform provides analytics tools to help users track their financial performance over time. Key metrics include:
- **Earnings Over Time**: A graph showing how much the user has earned over a specified period (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
- **Top-Earning Projects**: A breakdown of which projects or data assets have generated the most revenue.
- **Performance Insights**: Personalized insights that help users optimize their operations to maximize earnings (e.g., identifying high-demand data types or airspace zones).

### 4. Payment Processing with CIVIL Tokens
All payments within the CivilAirspace network are processed using **CIVIL tokens**, which are automatically transferred between users via smart contracts. The Track Earnings feature ensures that:
- Payments are only released when specific conditions are met (e.g., successful data delivery or milestone completion).
- Users can track the status of each payment in real-time.
- Smart contracts handle all payments securely and transparently.

### 5. Withdrawals and Conversions
Users can withdraw their CIVIL tokens or convert them into other supported cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies:
- **Withdrawals**: Users can transfer their CIVIL tokens to an external wallet for storage or further use.
- **Conversions**: CIVIL tokens can be converted into other cryptocurrencies (e.g., ETH) or fiat currencies through integrated exchange services.

## Use Case Scenarios

### Drone Operators
Drone operators can track earnings from selling aerial data collected during flights. They can view which projects generated the most revenue and optimize future operations based on demand trends.

### Camera Owners
Owners of Ring or Google Nest cameras who contribute footage to the network can monitor earnings from licensing agreements. They can see which footage is in high demand and adjust pricing accordingly.

### CivilScouts
CivilScouts who fulfill ad-hoc requests or contribute incidental footage can track their earnings in real-time. They can view which requests were most profitable and identify opportunities for future contributions.
