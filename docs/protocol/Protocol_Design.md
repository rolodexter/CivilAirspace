# Protocol Design and Base Level Contracts

## Overview
This document outlines the protocol design for the CivilAirspace network, including the base level contracts and their functionalities.

## Base Level Contracts

### 1. Airspace Licensing Contract

- Monitors airspace and operator compliance
- Manages violation reporting and resolution
- Coordinates with safety nodes

## Implementation
- Smart contracts deployed on [blockchain platform]
- Upgradeable contract architecture
- Multi-signature security
