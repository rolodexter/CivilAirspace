# CivilScouts

The **CivilScout** role in the CivilAirspace network is designed for individuals, researchers, and data consumers who are interested in acquiring or contributing data. CivilScouts can request specific aerial data from drone operators or contribute their own data, such as incidental footage or geo-tagged requests for others to fulfill.

## Core Responsibilities of CivilScouts

### 1. [Data Request Submission](../docs/Data_Request_Submission.md)
CivilScouts can submit detailed data requests for drone operators or outdoor camera owners (e.g., Ring and Google Nest cameras) to fulfill. This feature allows users to:
- Submit requests for aerial imagery, environmental data, or other specific datasets.
- Customize parameters such as location, time frame, altitude (for drones), and sensor requirements.
- Use pre-defined templates for common types of requests (e.g., land surveys, wildlife monitoring).
- View available drone operators and camera owners in real-time to see who can fulfill their requests.

### 2. [Ad-Hoc Data Collection](../docs/Ad_Hoc_Data_Requests.md)
CivilScouts can submit spontaneous geo-tagged data requests based on real-time observations. For example:
- A CivilScout hiking in Yosemite may spot a black bear but be unable to capture a photo. Using the **Ad-Hoc Data Collection** feature, they can leave a geo-tagged request asking other scouts or drone operators to capture an image if they see the bear.
- These requests remain active for a specified duration (e.g., 24 hours), allowing others nearby to fulfill them by submitting the requested data.
- Payments are processed using CIVIL tokens once the request is fulfilled.

### 3. [Incidental Footage Contribution](../docs/Incidental_Footage_Contribution.md)
CivilScouts can contribute incidental footage using their mobile devices:
- The app includes a **Mobile Camera Feature** that allows users to take photos or short videos while on the go.
- This incidental footage can be uploaded as data assets and listed on the marketplace for sale or licensing.
- This feature is ideal for capturing spontaneous events or observations that may be valuable to other users.

### 4. [Data Acquisition Management](../docs/Data_Acquisition_Management.md)
Once a data request is submitted, CivilScouts can track its progress through the app:
- Monitor the status of submitted requests, including acceptance by drone operators or camera owners.
- Manage ownership and usage rights for collected data.
- Receive collected data directly through the app once the operation is completed.

### 5. [Project Management](../docs/Project_Management.md)
CivilScouts can manage multiple data collection projects simultaneously:
- Use a unified project dashboard to track ongoing projects.
- Communicate directly with drone operators or camera owners to refine project details.
- Track project costs and manage payments using CIVIL tokens or other payment methods.

### 6. [Payment Processing](../docs/Payment_Processing.md)
The CivilScout App supports various payment methods to facilitate transactions between CivilScouts, drone operators, and camera owners:
- Payments can be made using CIVIL tokens or fiat currencies.
- Smart contracts ensure that payments are only released upon successful completion of requested tasks.

## Benefits of Being a CivilScout

### Access to Valuable Data
CivilScouts have access to a wide range of aerial and ground-based data collected by drone operators and outdoor camera owners. This includes:
- Aerial imagery from drones.
- Environmental monitoring data.
- Wildlife observations from outdoor cameras (e.g., Ring/Google Nest).

### Contribute to Community Projects
By submitting ad-hoc requests or contributing incidental footage, CivilScouts play an active role in community-driven data collection efforts. This helps build a valuable dataset that benefits researchers, environmentalists, and other stakeholders.

### Earn Rewards
CivilScouts can earn rewards in CIVIL tokens by contributing high-quality incidental footage or fulfilling ad-hoc requests from other users.

## Security Features

The CivilScout App includes robust security measures to protect user data and transactions:
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All communications between CivilScouts, drone operators, and camera owners are encrypted.
- **Secure Token Storage**: CIVIL tokens are stored securely using industry-standard encryption protocols.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Ensures account security across devices.

## Conclusion

The **CivilScout** role is integral to the success of the CivilAirspace network by enabling community-driven data collection efforts. Whether submitting formal research requests or contributing spontaneous observations through ad-hoc geo-tagged requests, CivilScouts help build a valuable dataset that benefits researchers, property owners, environmentalists, and more.
