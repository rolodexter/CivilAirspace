# CivilAirspace

A decentralized infrastructure network (DePIN) for managing low-altitude airspace. This repository is for brainstorming and documenting ideas around tokenized airspace, decentralized governance, droneports, and community-driven UAS traffic management.

## Vision: Creating a Coordination Layer for Civil Airspace

CivilAirspace aims to build a decentralized coordination layer for low-altitude airspace management. Our vision is to empower communities, property owners, and businesses to manage their airspace autonomously through blockchain technology and decentralized governance. By tokenizing airspace and enabling seamless coordination between drones and ground stations, we seek to create a scalable, secure, and community-driven infrastructure for the future of urban mobility.
