# CivilAirspace

***A decentralized infrastructure network (DePIN) for managing low-altitude airspace.***  

CivilAirspace is transforming how communities engage with the skies by creating a decentralized coordination layer for drone traffic management. Leveraging blockchain technology, decentralized governance, and tokenized airspace assets, we aim to unlock new possibilities for connectivity and efficiency.
