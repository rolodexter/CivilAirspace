# CivilAirspace

While our skies remain largely unused, property owners and drone operators await clear paths forward. CivilAirspace creates a decentralized coordination layer that enables communities to thoughtfully integrate drone technology into their airspace, ensuring controlled, purposeful usage that respects both innovation and tranquility.
